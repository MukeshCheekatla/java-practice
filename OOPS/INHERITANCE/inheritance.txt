Inheritance
--------------
1. Inheritance is a process of one class acquiring the properties of another class.

2. A class which gives or shares the properties is called the Super Class, Base Class, or Parent Class.

3. A class which acquires or accepts the properties is called the Sub Class, Derived Class, or Child Class.

4. In Java, we achieve inheritance using the 'extends' keyword.

5. Inheritance is also referred to as an "IS-A" Relationship.

6. In Java, only variables and methods are inherited where as blocks and constructors are not.
