blocks
-------
1. Blocks are a set of Instructions/Block of code for initialization.
2. Blocks are genereally categorized 
        a. static block
        b. non-static 
        
 ====================================================================

static block
------------
1. static blocks are a set of instructions ussed to initializing static variables.

syntax: static
            {

            }

2. static blocks always gets executed even before main()  or during class loading time.

3. we can have multiple static blocks and the execution will happen in a sequential Manner.


non- static block
-----------------
1. Non-static blocks are a set of instructions ussed to initializing static variables and non-static variables.

syntax: static
            {

            }

2. Non-static blocks always gets executed during object creation(Instantiation).

3. we can have multiple Non-static blocks and the execution will happen in a sequential Manner.
