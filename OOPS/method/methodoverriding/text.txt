Method Overriding
-------------------------

1. The process of Inheriting the method and changing the implementation/Definition of the inherited method is called as method overriding.

2. In order to achieve method overriding, we have to follow the below rules:
    i. Method Name must be same.
    ii. Arguments should be same
    iii. returntype should also be same.

Note:
1. Access Specifier should be same or of Higher Visibility.
2. While Overriding a method we can optionally use annotation ie. @Override
3. annotation was introduced from JDK 1.5
