CONSTRUCTOR CHAINING
--------------------
1. The Process of one constructor calling another constructor is called as constructor chaining.

2. Constructor Chaining can be achieved only in case of constructor overloading.

3. Constructor Chaining can happen in two ways:

a. Constructor Chaining in same class can be achieved using this calling statement ie. this().
b. Constructor Chaining in another class can be achieved using super calling statement ie. super() & Is-a relationship.

Note :
1. this() or super() should always be the first executable line within the constructor.
2. Recursive Chaining is not possible, Therefore if there are 'n' constructors we can have a maximum of 'n-1' calling statements.

1. super() is used to invoke or call constructor of another class.
    a. IS-A (Inheritance) --> extends
    b. super() ie. super calling statement.

super() can be used in 2 ways:

i.IMPLICITLY:
-----------
When we create an object of a class, and if that class has a super class,
and if that super class has a non-parameterized constructor,
then the sub class constructor will invoke the super class constructor implicitly.

ii.EXPLICITLY:
-----------
When we create an object of a class, and if that class has a super class,
and if that super class has a parameterized constructor,
then the sub class constructor should invoke the super class constructor explicitly,
otherwise we get compile time error.
