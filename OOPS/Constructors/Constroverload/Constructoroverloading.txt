Constructor Overloading
------------------------
1. The process of having multiple constructors in the same class with differences in arguments.

2. To achieve Constructor Overloading, at least one of the following rules must be followed:
   a. Change in the number of arguments (length).
   b. Change in the datatype of the arguments.
   c. Change in the sequence/order of argument datatypes.
