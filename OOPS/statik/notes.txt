static
----------
1. static is a keyword which can be used with class, variable, method and blocks.

2. The Class loader loads all the static properties inside a memory location called as Class Area or Static Pool.

3. All the static properties has to accessed with hwlp of ClassName.

4. static properties can be accessed directly or with the help of classname in the same class.

5. static properties can be accessed only with the help of ClassName in the different /another class.

syntax : ClassName.variable Name or ClassName.methodname()

Note:
1. STATIC PROPERTIES ARE LOADED ONLY ONCE, therefore they will have a single copy.

2.all objects will implicity be pointing to the static poll,
 therefore we can access static properties with object reference but not a good practice
